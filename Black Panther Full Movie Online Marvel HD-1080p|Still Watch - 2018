Saw Black Panther over the weekend and can’t stop thinking about it? We don’t blame you: In the tradition of director Ryan Coogler’s previous movies (Fruitvale Station and Creed), Black Panther is a heady film with layers 

of meaning, and it’s already sparking passionate debates among viewers. As star Michael B. Jordan (who plays villain Erik Killmonger) recently told EW, “There’s talks and conversations in the film about identity, culture, 

history, heritage, love, pain, sorrow, happiness — it’s a lot!”

We already knew this movie was going to be good. It was definitely worth the wait, worth the hype and worth the anticipation.

“Black Panther” is centered around Prince T’Challa (the Black Panther, portrayed by Chadwick Boseman) who ascends the throne of Wakanda (a fictional, Afrofuturistic country in the Marvel Universe) after the death of his 

father. Wakanda has a major supply of Vibranium, a precious metal used to advance Wakandan technology, which is kept hidden from the outside world.

The movie combines the perfect mix of drama, humor and action. With the help of an amazingly talented, almost all African-American cast, “Black Panther” not only breaks Hollywood’s chain of consistency with casting 

mainly white lead actors, but it does so in a way that shows just how prized movies can be when focused on different cultures and ethnicities. Not to mention, having focused on several strong female lead actors (Lupita 

Nyong’o, Danal Gurira and Letitia Wright) made the film even better than expected.
